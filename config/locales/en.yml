        info: |
          OpenIPC U-Boot overwrites the original crypto partition making it impossible to revert to the factory 
          firmware unless you have a full flash backup for this particular camera! To create a full firmware backup
          start a TFTP server and run these commands in bootloader shell.

          The camera will automatically restart and boot with the brand new bootloader.
          Stay focused and prepare to interrupt the booting sequence in order to get back into the bootloader shell.

          The full firmware image consists of bootloader, kernel and root filesystem, and is also suitable for flashing
          memory chip using a programmer.
